    "Insertion sort is basically looking at an array of elements from left to right. We do not look at the whole array at once but only step by step, increasing the scope of \"sorted\" array by 1 element at a time. If newly scoped element is less than previous element, we enter a loop that will iteratively move the selected element towards the left until the element on it's left side is either less or equal to the current observed element."
